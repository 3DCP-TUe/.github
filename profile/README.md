# 3DCP TU/e

The goal of the TU/e 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) research program is to establish concrete printing as a viable new method to manufacture concrete elements and buildings, and to fundamentally understand its processes. The research group operates and develops its own 3D Concrete Printing facility at the Department of the Built Environment. The research facilities consist of a large-scale gantry printer, as well as numerous large- and small-scale industrial robot arms. The research group has access to a wide range of (non-)destructive experimental facilities to characterize printable materials, as well as numerical tools to analyze the process and design printable structures. 

The program is run by the chair of Concrete Structures of the Unit Structural Design, in close collaboration with the chairs of Innovative Structural Design, Applied Mechanics, as well as Architectural Design and Engineering. Within the 3DCP program, numerous PhD, EngD, MSc and other research projects is being conducted.

The research activities are supported by a consortium of (inter)national industrial partners and academic colleagues. Their contribution and involvement is gratefully acknowledged.
